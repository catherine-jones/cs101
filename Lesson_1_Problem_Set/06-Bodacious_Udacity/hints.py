# Please write HINTS here

# From the README:
# We do NOT accept pull requests that have deleted another contributer's hint or solution without a very clear reason
# ONLY use concepts covered in the class so far
# Do NOT give solutions here - ONLY hints

# Given the variables s and t defined as:
s = 'udacity'
t = 'bodacious'
# write Python code that prints out udacious
# without using any quote characters in
# your code.

# Decide which letter you want to use in each variable 
# Use the square braces to select the letters
# Use + to concatenate the letters
# Use print to view your results
