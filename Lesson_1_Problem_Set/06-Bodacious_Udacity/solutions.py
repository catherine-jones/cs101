# Please write SOLUTIONS here

# From the README:
# We do NOT accept pull requests that have deleted another contributer's hint or solution without a very clear reason
# ALL solutions must be clearly documented
# ALL solutions must actually work
# ONLY use concepts covered in the class so far

# Given the variables s and t defined as:
s = 'udacity'
t = 'bodacious'
# write Python code that prints out udacious
# without using any quote characters in
# your code.

print s[:-5] + t[-3:]
