# Please write SOLUTIONS here

# From the README:
# We do NOT accept pull requests that have deleted another contributer's hint or solution without a very clear reason
# ALL solutions must be clearly documented
# ALL solutions must actually work
# ONLY use concepts covered in the class so far

# Assume text is a variable that
# holds a string. Write Python code
# that prints out the position
# of the second occurrence of 'zip'
# in text, or -1 if it does not occur
# at least twice.

# For example,
#text = 'all zip files are zipped' 
# >>> 18
# text = 'all zip files are compressed'
# >>> -1

text = "all zip files are zipped" 

#ENTER CODE BELOW HERE

print first_zip = text.find('zip', text.find('zip')+1)
